  # SpotifyPlus Sample Automation for Voice Assist Support
  # Author: Todd Lucas
  # GitHub Project: https://github.com/thlucas1/homeassistantcomponent_spotifyplus
  #
  # The listed automations in this example will enable HA Voice Assist support for 
  # the specified SpotifyPlus media player entity.  You can clone this example for
  # as many SpotifyPlus media players that you have defined.
  #
  # Reporting Issues / Problems:
  # - use the SpotifyPlus Integration github repository issue link to report any
  #   problems with these automations:
  #   https://github.com/thlucas1/homeassistantcomponent_spotifyplus/issues
  #
  # configuration.yaml changes:
  # - If you have not done so, I recommend adding a subfolder structure under
  #   your HA <config> path that contains an "automations" folder which can
  #   store multiple automation YAML files.  For example:
  #   <config>
  #   .. myconfigs
  #   .... automations
  #   ...... voice_assist_spotifyplus_todd_l.yaml
  #   ...... voice_assist_spotifyplus_todd_l_free.yaml
  #   ...... your_other_yaml_file.yaml
  # - You can then add the following to your configuration.yaml file to load
  #   all automation *.yaml files in that folder into your HA configuration:
  #   automation ui: !include automations.yaml                           # Automations created by the UI.
  #   automation manual: !include_dir_merge_list myconfigs/automations/  # Automations created outside of the UI.
  # - Refer to the "Splitting up the Configuration" document for more information.
  #   https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/splitting_configuration/#advanced-usage
  #
  # Do the following to add this to your HA environment:
  # - Make a copy of this YAML and save to your HA "<config>/automations" folder.
  #   The file should be named as "voice_assist_SPOTIFYPLUS_ENTITY.yaml", 
  #   where "SPOTIFYPLUS_ENTITY" is YOUR SpotifyPlus media player entity id suffix.
  #   For example, mine would be "voice_assist_spotifyplus_todd_l.yaml"
  #   since my SpotifyPlus media player entity_id suffix is "spotifyplus_todd_l".
  # - Open the file copy that you just made in your YAML editor of choice.
  # - Change all references of "spotifyplus_todd_l" to YOUR SpotifyPlus entity id suffix.
  # - Save your changes.
  # - Go to "Developer Tools \ YAML" and click on the "Automations" button under 
  #   the "YAML Configuration Reloading" to reload all automation scripts.
  # - Issue a Voice Assist Command to test:
  #   Say "Play Spotify Favorite Tracks" and wait for the magic to happen.
