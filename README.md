- click on `download` to start the download. It will install the spotifyplus integration to your config/custom_components directory.
- restart HA to start using the component.

## Manual Installation

- Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
- If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
- In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `spotifyplus`.
- Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/spotifyplus/` directory (folder) in this repository.
- Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
- Restart Home Assistant.
- In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "SpotifyPlus"

## Configuration 

[Integration configuration](https://github.com/thlucas1/homeassistantcomponent_spotifyplus/wiki/Installation-Instructions#configuration) is mostly done in the UI, but a configuration file is required for specific device functionality (e.g. Sonos, Chromecast, etc).

## Advanced Logging Support

The SmartInspectPython package (installed with this integration) can be used to easily debug the integration.
Note that the standard Home Assistant logger is also supported, but does not provide as much information as the SmartInspect logger.

Check out the [SmartInspect Logging Configuration wiki page](https://github.com/thlucas1/homeassistantcomponent_spotifyplus/wiki/SmartInspect-Logging-Configuration) for more information on how to configure and enable / disable advanced logging.
